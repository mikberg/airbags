title: What is Airbags?

Airbags is a cool new way of creating static web pages. You should use it.
Or, hopefully, that is. Right now, I don't know, to be honest. Let's see if it
works in practice first.

```js
var hello = console.log('hei');
```

## But what *is* it?

Its a Node-project which transforms a set of files, e.g. Markdown-files, like
this one, into a context. It also provides context apis and ways of rendering
the context back into files.

The end goal is to create a generator for isomorphic static sites (!).
